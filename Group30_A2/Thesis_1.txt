Qube management has placed strong emphasis on Moorebank Logistics Park being the key driver of the companys long-term growth. However, we believe the market is mispricing its short-term contribution. While the IMEX terminal is profitable, its throughput is still below capacity due to a longer than expected ramp up period. Furthermore, the more important Interstate Terminal is not expected to be fully operational until FY2027, with earnings contribution being highly dependent on rail demand and tenant uptake. The terminal is also highly reliant on successful network integration with Inland Rail, budget risks and political uncertainties. 
Ultimately, the market is treating Moorebank as a growth driver when in reality, it is still earnings drag, and its payoff is not guaranteed in the current high-interest rate environment.
