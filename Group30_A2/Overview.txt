Qube Holdings (ASX:QUB) is regarded as one of the most integrated logistics and infrastructure companies in Australia, with operations spanning container transport, bulk commodity logistics and port terminal services. However, despite recent growth and a robust portfolio of infrastructure assets our team believes the market is overestimating its medium to long term earnings potential. A deeper analysis reveals that recent performance has been buoyed by one-off macroeconomic tailwinds, acquisition-driven earnings and optimism around long dated infrastructure projects such as Moorebank. With valuation multiples stretched and organic growth plateauing we initiate coverage with a SELL recommendation. Our thesis is based on the view that Qubes short-term operational and cyclical risks are underappreciated and the current stock price resembles a best case scenario for growth that is unlikely to fully materialise.
