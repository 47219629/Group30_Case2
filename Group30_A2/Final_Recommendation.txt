Coverage on Qube Holdings Ltd (ASX:QUB) is initiated with a sell recommendation and a price target of A$3.52. The blended valuation, combining discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and relative valuation metrics, indicates that the stock is currently trading above its intrinsic value. In light of a weaker trade outlook, increasing cost pressures, and the absence of near-term earnings catalysts, the current market price appears to overestimate Qubes underlying fundamentals. Based on this analysis, a downside in the share price is anticipated over the medium term.
