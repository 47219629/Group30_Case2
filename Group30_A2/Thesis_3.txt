Patrick, which contributes approximately 1/3 of Qubes earnings, is facing challenging structural headwinds. The Australian stevedoring market is oversupplied, with multiple competitors such as DP World, Hutchinson and VICT all fighting for limited volume growth. Consequently, Qubes pricing power in the sector is rapidly deteriorating, with yields per TEU also flattening out. Recent attempts by Patrick to increase ancillary charges have attracted regulatory and media scrutiny, further risking future pricing flexibility. 
Additionally, labour relations continue to be a key operational risk, with the Maritime Union of Australia threatening further strikes in the 2nd half of FY2025 due to wage dissatisfaction. Any further industrial action at ports will substantially disrupt Patricks service reliability and earnings, particularly if during peak shipping season.
From a valuation perspective, the upside optionality of a Patrick monetisation event (IPO or sale) is increasingly unlikely in the current macroeconomic environment. With thin margins, unattractive returns and high regulatory risk, Patrick is unlikely to be valued at the premium multiples typically associated with quality infrastructure assets.  
Therefore, we believe that Patricks contribution to Qubes valuation is overestimated, and it represents a source of negative investor sentiment until industry dynamics improve.
