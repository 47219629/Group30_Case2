Despite Qubes strong FY24 headline growth, further analysis reveals that underlying organic growth is plateauing. Key segments such as container logistics and cargo handling are seeing limited volume growth and substantial pricing pressure from competitive contracts, eroding margin expansion. Most of the EBITDA growth in FY24 was driven by bolt-on acquisitions such as Aurizon WA and Colemans Transport, which are now being absorbed into the portfolio. 
Moving forward, Qube will shift into integration mode, where we can expect to see lower EBITDA growth and higher operational costs. This is likely to be further exacerbated as synergies from past deals prove harder to capture than originally assumed. Colemans regional WA operations and MIRRATs Melbourne terminal require system integration, cultural alignment and cost base restructuring, all of which are expected to weigh down on short-term margins.  
Furthermore, Qube is approaching the limit of the number of long-hanging bolt-on targets available in the market. Without additional accretive M&A, earnings momentum is expected to taper off materially by FY26. Margin upside is also limited given the likely impact of inflationary pressures on labour, fuel and maintenance costs.
