The Qube FY2025 H1 reflect strong financial performance with revenue increasing by 28.4% on 1H24 driven by organic growth and acquisitions. EBITDA rose 14% supported by strong performance in the Logistics Infrastructure Ports and Bulk divisions. However due to higher than expected depreciation and amortisation, EBIT and NPAT did not rise by similar levels. Whilst remaining within the Qube target range of 30%-40%, gearing rose to 32.5% in 1H25 reflecting a temporary increase in working capital to support grain trading. A fully franked dividend of 4.1 cents was declared reflecting a 2.5% increase on 1H24 indicating stable near term cash flows.
