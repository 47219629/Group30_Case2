The valuation of QUB has been undertaken using a structured discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on a detailed projection of the company's financial performance over the period FY2025 to FY2029. Free cash flows to the firm have been derived from forecast EBITDA adjusted for tax capital expenditure and changes in working capital. A terminal value has been calculated using both the perpetuity growth method, assuming a terminal growth rate of 2.8%. Future cash flows and terminal value have been discounted to present value using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.4%. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted on key variables, including the WACC and the terminal growth rate, to assess the robustness of the valuation outcomes. To cross-validate the DCF a trading comparable analysis has been conducted using peer EBITDA multiples, alongside a precedent transaction analysis referencing sector M&A activity.
