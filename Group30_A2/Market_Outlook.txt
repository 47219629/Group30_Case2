The forward outlook for Qube appears increasingly challenged despite management indication of at least 5% EPSA/NPATA growth in FY25. While demand in agricultural sectors is expected to remain constant, these tailwinds are largely cyclical and subject to fluctuations. Moreover the automotive segment remains under potential with limited demand and further supply chain constraints to possibly occur. Additionally costs have continued to rise which are likely to weigh on profit margins. The macroenvironment in which Qube operates is expected to challenge volume growth with potential volatility in tariff regimes and international trade policies posing risk to key logistics flows especially import-export operations. These external pressures combined with long term infrastructure investments such as Moorebank suggest that earning may be limited to the near term.
