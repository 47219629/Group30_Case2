We have identified a number of short-medium term catalysts that are likely to drive down the Qube share price, supporting our SELL recommendation.  
Catalyst 1: Delays or cost overruns at Moorebank Interstate Terminal 
Qubes Moorebank Interstate Terminal is a key growth driver priced into the stock, but it is not immune to project risk. Potential delays in final commissioning, cost overruns due to inflation, or tenant rollout issues could push earnings contribution to FY28 or beyond, weakening the Moorebank bull case. Any update in future results indicating a delay in the terminals timeline or a CAPEX blowout is likely to prompt a repricing of the stock.  
Catalyst 2: Patrick operational weakness or regulatory action 
If Patrick continues to underperform due to port congestion, labour disputes and pricing pressures, Qubes earning growth will be capped. Additionally, ACCC scrutiny on terminal charges could force Patrick to limit infrastructure charges, impairing margin expansion strategies. If regulatory developments are unfavourable, the market is likely to revise Patricks equity value to be substantially lower. 
Catalyst 3: Rising debt servicing costs amid high CAPEX profile 
With interest rates expected to remain elevated throughout 2025, Qubes floating debt base will continue to attract higher servicing costs. If management is forced to increase leverage to complete projects, it is likely that Qube will face further EPS dilution and erosion of return on equity, especially if key projects underdeliver.
